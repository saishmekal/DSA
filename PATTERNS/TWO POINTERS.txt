# Two Pointers Pattern â€“ Summary

## ðŸ“˜ Definition
The **Two Pointers** technique uses two variables to efficiently traverse a data structure, often reducing time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n).

## ðŸ§  When to Use
- Sorted arrays or lists
- Pair/triplet searching
- Removing duplicates
- Cycle detection in linked lists

## ðŸ“Œ Pointer Variants
| Type             | Description                            | Example           |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Opposite Ends     | Start from both ends                  | Two Sum (Sorted)  |
| Same Direction    | Move from start together              | Remove Duplicates |
| Different Speeds  | Fast & slow pointers                  | Detect Cycle      |

## ðŸ•’ Time Complexity
Most two pointer solutions run in **O(n)** time.
